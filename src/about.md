Hi, I'm Jason Ford. For this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), I'm exploring data visualization using [D3](https://d3js.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

In the past, I've used Advent of Code to learn new programming languages like Haskell and Rust. I'm focusing on TypeScript and React this year—both of which I already know well—to shore up my coding skills which have likely gone a little stale over a couple years without coding actively.
